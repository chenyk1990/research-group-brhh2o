Yangkang Chen is a seismologist and team lead for AI/ML research at the Texas Seismological Network (TexNet) at The University of Texas at Austin. He received a Ph.D. degree in geophysics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2015. From 2016 to 2018, he was a distinguished postdoctoral research associate with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. His research interests include seismic signal analysis, seismic modeling and inversion, deep learning, and high-performance computing. Chen dedicates a significant amount of his time to open-source reproducible research, for instance, projects like Advanced Array Seismic data Processing and Imaging Platform , Chen's Github , and Chen's reproducible research.

After joining UT-Austin, Chen has been dedicated to the development of a mature and robust AI system from scratch for automatically picking the P- and S-wave arrival times, P-wave first-motion polarities and conducting the follow-up analysis to create automatic and highly complete seismic catalog and focal mechanisms of thousands of small (magnitude<1.5) earthquakes. Chen's AI system has been in production and now is the baseline model for TexNet analysts to conduct daily analysis and earthquake monitoring, which helps significantly reduce the manual workload and improve the analysis quality.
